Listening to music is a weird exercise. From a human standpoint, I mean (personally I hope that I’ve conveyed that I promote it heavily). The physical part of it (wiggly air make your brain go brr?) is one part, considering our emotional response is another, and reverse engineering the intent of the artist is still another. I try not to think about this when I’m transcribing, but a lot of the time it comes through. This (well, mostly this), is why I encourage you to try a transcription of your own. Find a quiet space and pick an album. Shut out as many distractions as possible, and write in the way you are most comfortable writing. The objective is that you don’t think about the act of writing (instead focusing on your body sensations as you listen). If you’re looking for an album to start, consider TWO LANES’s Reflections EP. Oh, and if you do intend to transcribe it, skip this post!

I am modulating up and down with a bounce that reminds me of my connection with the earth. Gravity is a vector that convinces us of down, and we spend our well-earned energy on defining up. Down and up and down and up. Whether we are down or up or somewhere in between, the fabric around us has its own orientation. Whether our surroundings postures and poses for us, we see it in strange motion. We go up, they appear to be going down. Bouncing along with a surreal swing. The orientation of my sweet sighing perception shifts front to back.

My senses are lubricated by velvet and glycerine. In this place, no sharp corners loom, only swaying curves. Swishing curtains shifting their anchor in and out of space. I pat my hand against my heart to remind myself of my self. I have the right to keep my head and allow the sensations to be felt, not losing myself for a moment. My head tilts and I see the movement of the objects around me in a different way. They call out and I don’t ask why. The beauty in a petition can be seen more readily at a tilt. I feel the question more when I’m not attempting to communicate an answer. The emptiness that exists at the end of a solution is the loneliest punctuation.

My fingertips crab slowly along a smooth fader. Gently communicating my desire to stay without answering — my touch telegraphing a longing for an eternity of asking. Maybe there’s another time for me. Out of time? I feel out of time, but my body reminds me that I am the timekeeper. The gentle rain sets a pattering tempo, as does the sweep of a broom, and the shuffle of feet. The space inside an hourglass echoes with the dropping sand as it piles and cascades before turning over again. The life of the grain of sand starts and ends with falling. The portal to life and death is waiting there, in the waist of the glass. My feet beat a rhythm of their own along the beach, their envelopes fold into the rolling waves. What a journey a sound undertakes as it expands across our world. I hope it wishes to be heard as much as I wish to hear it.

The movement blankets over me and the sound tells me nothing. I feel and I feel and I feel as if I understand. I displace myself and sounds emerge in response. There’s so much more here than what I can see and hear. This space distills itself for my benefit into a geometry that resembles my own. Symmetries don’t evolve, they are knapped from raw material so we are already present when they appear. Meaning is imbued into the reduction. Simplicity , structure, and safety. I feel them all in the caramel colored billows of song.

My spine wants more than my lungs can give it. I feel vital and my chest moves into a position to receive the sun. I take the warmth, not for myself, but in order to become more than me. I want to stretch thin and harden. To temper my understanding with what I can’t perceive. I want to become a shield. A place where, inside me, all things can survive the unfiltered reality of being. The warmth melts me into a red hot drip and as I attempt to stretch, to spread, to share, I become everywhere. The sounds draw me across to places unseen and guide me, gently, to the sweetest emotions. I see now that I am being guided to the center of my unfiltered perception. At the center is an obsidian knife, responsible for the pruning and paring of life’s ripe fruit. My heart reveals its pleasure to finally see me again. In my liquid state, I can be anywhere and be happy. With a smile, we agree that I can instead be everywhere. Lightning is my shape, and what is waiting for me becomes my destination. A guitar taps down through the sand and I harden along the imperfections of the human hand that deftly shakes its strings. Far from my final form, but, until I become sand again, I wait to be found. In the earth, surrounded by my past and future selves.

Thank you for coming along with me, and, as always: take my words with a grain of salt; do your own research; and be careful.
