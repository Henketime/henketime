Love is a gently shaking heart and an effortless release of breath. On Live From Collins Music Hall EP, Benedict Cork connected me to the epicenter of an intimate vibration. I was closest when his piano and voice melded, emphasized by a percussive wave, or a gentle tapping. Over the span of 21 minutes I was pushed and pulled from a heartful place of origin origin and taken on a ride which, at times, seemed a bit greedy for my happiness.

After acclimating, I felt escorted beneath the mantle, plunged into the serene, then jarred like an exotic fruit waiting to become jelly. It felt a bit disorienting, like I was being expected to navigate a discontinuous album tone. I was tethered and disoriented, coerced in and out, often spinning but always trying to get me to drop my guard. And drop it I did. Every damn time. Right now, I feel Cork’s voice make its way down through my shoulders to warm my chest like honey on my ribs. The tone of the instruments parting my liminal spaces to make room for a bodily beauty. I don’t want it to end, because I don’t know what to expect. I keep peering around each composed corner, eager to dive into another sweet caress.

This is a live performance, caught on tape, and as such, Cork often says the phrase “thank you”. As much as I believe each word, I become very annoyed. I know he’s not talking to me, and I get jealous of the audience. I experience the music through the air between me and a speaker, but these nameless few experience an omni-directional embrace. Even the very few sour notes could sink in more successfully when reflected off of the walls of the Collins Music Hall. Maybe it’s just me, but knowing this isn’t for me disappoints me, but maybe one day it could be. A voyeur’s mind I do not possess.

Benedict Cork presents a part of his love, but sharing the whole of his talent. Whether it’s the very personal core-based “The Lucky Ones” which (at no fault of Cork’s) could not have landed with me, or a more momentum-driven piece like “Have a Good Life (See You Never)”, bringing a fresh supply of blood to my extremities, Cork gives more of himself than maybe even he realizes. He shakes and he holds, but even his most well-rehearsed notes convey a channel for a direct connection.

As always, take my words with a grain of salt, do your own research, and be careful.
