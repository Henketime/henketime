This album is the second to come to me from a subscriber. Thank you very much. Please send more, and I’ll get to them as I can.

Ominous is a great way to start a story, and a terrifying way to end one. Ominous telegraphs danger. It allows us to see the thread of the imminent. I go to great lengths to find the omens around me. I have to look hard, and even when I find them, I’m almost always wrong. But in a story, ah! Anticipation is one of the 12 principals of animation, and it (like setting) is a true gift to the audience. How the scene begins sets our expectations for how the scene will end. Mondo Psycho opens with a bulging wall of torment and ecstasy and, in retrospect, I can think of no better way to set the stage this 41 minute and 17 second cyclonic drama. Short passages in the emotional landscape turn quickly, so you’d better stay alert.

I am unsettled when the beat thumps across my shoulders, left to right. It arrived like a ballista bolt. A woman is beckoning me to the heart of her chamber. Her words are a rolling pin doused in kerosine pressing across my senses. They burn my ribs inward, and I see her. I have never known her or her archetype. The succubus. The harlot. Her honey pot sticks my feet to the floor, compelling me to stay. I truly see her, although she looks through me. She shouts over my back and into the encroaching darkness. I know she is shouting in defiance against my ghosts. This is my reward for connecting to her. I don’t know how, but I can feel her tone, like a focused hot stream on my sternum. She is hot, and I am hot.

A slow screeching sound scratches away my armor. I want things I’ve never heard of. I want things I’ve never called by name. I want things I have hated. I can only stare up at her hazy figure, smoke billowing up, fog rolling down. I feel her words slowly drape themselves over my head, and upon my shoulders like a cloak of sweet-smelling clay. It weighs me down, but I feel mighty. I am an adventurer. No one will ever have what I will have. I turn and twirl, ready to slay valiantly, and when I come full circle, my patron is gone. In her place, a wooden figurine, striking and vibrant. Its legs crossed, leaning toward me slightly. Its face eyeless, but its tightly-grained body contains light. Shining streaks of white emanate from its joints. Looking closely, I see that it is bound. The space behind the oaken knees and ankles illuminating corners of the room revealing a message on the walls. It all unfolds under my keen mind. I am inside a puzzle that I am certain was meant for me. I try to decipher the meaning, but, out of nowhere, I am dizzied by a cyclone of sound. Power in each chord, mastery in each note. I stand fast, pushed backwards and down into the loose soil. I stand to meet the danger, but the scene disappears again.

The lights slowly come up, and a wondrous sound swells! The source seems invisible, but I know that I am directly in its path. I pull my cupped hands toward and over my body, sweeping the powerful sound in but claiming only a phantom. Still, whatever I claim tingles the inside of my skull, inspiring me to build my resolve again. Thumping footsteps, a prelude to danger. They arrive long after they should, and when they do, the sound is deafening. I now know the form of my monster and it is beautiful. The fiends stature mocks my diminutive figure. And when her fog arrives, trailing like a tattered dress’s train, the vampiress, Carmilla, cares nothing for me. Caught beneath her, her gravity overwhelms my gravitas. A grave opens under my gaze, my grave. I can not withstand her careless assault, but I cherish it. I delight in my position, my standing. No longer enthralled I resolve to remain. I know I will never be happy, but at least I can be radiant. I beam and my body goes cold. I am discarded, and I know what it means to be meaningless.

As I abandon my unlicked wounds, I hear a call, and I see a battle of sorts unfold. The true battle, where wills collide. The bound wooden figure is spinning up in the sky, pushing the bindings beyond their tensile strength. It splinters some, making its figure something more than it was, allowing flowing light to creep out against the fog of the colossus. Disappearing into the smother, I see only a suppressed ball of light. Then, growing in signal and in sound, light becomes lightning in a dense cloud. Its righteous rage revealing itself. The being at the center of power takes from me my resolve. I lean in, thinking somehow that if I could, I would give it everything. My pride swells and, for the first time, I feel satisfied. The marionette rises out through the obscurity of its own authority. It stands to lose everything, but it stands tall. I watch with my insides forming an arrow from the center of my chest. I want to see this through, but I want to turn away. I cover my face, but my hands are transparent.

I ache all over, sore from the weight of the mantle given to me by the shapeshifting giantess. Desperately, I try to unfasten it from my collar, but it ensorcels my body. The edges of the cloak have rooted around the walls of my grave, and I fight to remain at least a witness to the events in front of me. The massive-limbed beast begins an incantation, and it takes an eternity to actualize. The fog disappears, and the smoke grows tendrils, spinning somatic, burning with intensity. I can’t tell if the incantation ends, but everything becomes fire and silence. When I come to, I am six feet in the earth. A lone voice pushes through the polluted sky. Sadness drenches my desert lungs. I can’t tell from whom the voice comes. I can’t tell if the victory is pyrrhic or just remorseful. I want to grab all the pieces, everything in this god forsaken world, and squeeze them together. To push it all into a mold and teach it to speak the events as they happened.

From deep inside, I feel a spasmodic coughing cry vomit out of me. In the chaos, two new voices have emerged, compounding my confusion. Confounding my senses. Delusions or not, I have to wrench truth from this nightmare landscape. Unresolved tragedy is my true grave. As I ponder the result of the battle, the entire set transforms. The ground below me becomes granular, giving way along with my stances claim to it. Down and further down the bottom of the world is a sieve, sifting out all unnecessary parts of the play. Will I be held in the mesh cradle, or will I fall through with the backdrop? Either way, I think, will be preferable to what I am currently, which I fear ended long ago. If I remain, I will be caged. Doomed to participate as a player. If, however, I fall through, I will transform into that which I always should have been. The audience. A spectator, safe in my suburban sanctuary, fighting my own colossi, and living in between the my own tragedies, waiting for a resolution that may never come.

As always, take my words with a grain of salt, do your own research, and be careful.
