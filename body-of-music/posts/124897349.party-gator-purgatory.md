I ask a lot of questions. To be honest, I have to resist putting a dozen rhetorical questions into these posts. I push myself to admit what I don’t know. So when I have the opportunity to listen to music that challenges me in similar ways, or forces me to ask question after question, I take it. For fifty-four and a half minutes, this album sends me spiraling into self-doubt of the best kind. And then for days after, the spiraling momentum continues. Even now, I hear the echoes from within.

“Where did I go wrong in my life?”, my body presses as I sit, peacefully absorbing the surreal vibrations of PARTY GATOR PURGATORY. Something growls through me and spins me across two reels, endlessly, but always reminding me exactly where I am. I strain to hear distant sounds, and am greeted by deafening shouts. A wall of sound brushes me, removing impurities, leaving a dust cloud shaped like me. I want to feel like this all the time. I am confused. I am healthy.


There is nothing binding this music together. The silence, the violence, and the mycelia are utterly activated and deactivated by the whim of a cruel conductor. Each instrument is a greased knob smeared across a pulsing wall. I want to be as free as these collected compositions, nothing holding them together, nothing keeping them real in my mind.


To this day, I can’t hum a single bar of this damnable album. Where did I go wrong in my life? Why is something so important to me, but so disconnected from my call? How can we ride the space between the waves? Like Einstein’s train, but no…this album is anything but light. The music sounds the same no matter where I’m seated.


I willingly sacrifice my attention to the album’s rhythm. The lure is so strong and I take too much off. Why am I…? My whole heart spins inside my chest, believing my diaphragm to be a whirlpool. My breathing has slowed, its frequency now a distance between two crests. Everything has a rhythm. PURGATORY owns my everything.


So familiar…words, notes, kicks, tinks, blarps, fffffafbfdfhfpfsdsdsds. Try and try to break the code. Test the limits, break the code. I just need a safe place to store my mind. Where did I go wrong in my life?


As always, take my words with a grain of salt, do your own research, and be careful.
