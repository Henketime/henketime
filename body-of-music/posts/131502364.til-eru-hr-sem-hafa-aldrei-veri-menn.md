In July of 2011, NYIÞ created something that took almost twelve years to reach me. A soundscape which, only thirty minutes and four seconds in album length, seems to have cost me a lifetime. A string of soundwaves that led me to a dangerous place, and an unexpected message. I opened myself wide, and brushed against something whose value may never be known to me. I was utterly shocked at the timing of this album. Both reaching me, and the timing of elements within the album. The journey contains milestones that I hit like clockwork. I can’t explain it, but it begins before it begins.

Immediately, I am welcomed by brass and brass. The textures both beautiful and known. I feel glue underneath the old planks, in between the in between of each piece. Sharp geometry emerges slowly from the scene, and disappears without malice. Something is being heralded and I begin to have my doubts. I suspect now that the welcoming brass is not for me, and perhaps it is not welcoming at all. I am a witness; an onlooker. I have become insignificant now, in a space that is both large and ruinous. Echoes reflect sound, but, at the same time, a viscous energy heavier than sound. I feel the presence of giant gate doors as they are opened deliberately. All of the metal surrounding me sighs, at the exact moment I do. I am weary from waiting. I am fatigued by the stillness. Alternating voices weave in and out of the thick air like muscles wedging and passing away from their origins. The tone in the huge room shifts. No, the tone has shifted, and I am just now learning about the change from the rumors the echoes tell. What I once hoped would become music drones in and out of my consciousness, stealthily mounting my anticipation. Anticipation that is not rewarded, for what is heralded is what is doing the heralding. I feel the force of the droning push heavy on my back. My bones bend with each breath I take against it. Then, suddenly, I realize my dread. It has been here, and just like the vile echoes, I know that it has already been signaled long in the past. The burden is becoming unbearable. Harsh noises penetrate what I mistook as sacred space. I am alone in a space between flight and freeze. I manage to shake and wriggle out from under what was inside me. I measure my breathing, taking stock of my capabilities. Grateful for the ability to quantify.

A warm light emerges behind me, but I can’t turn to greet it. I am afraid of what it portends, and even though I am not moving, I am fleeing. For the first time, I feel that I am somewhere. It is not somewhere I have ever wanted to be. I experience a hunger for anything but this place. It is a desert. It is a march. It is an unmistakable worn ring of futility. A massacre of immortal souls has continued to occur here, since when, I don’t know. Resigned voices breath loud shouts, not of protest, but of unheard self-affirmation. Do they know they continue to wear the ring? The march continues, but I have stopped. This spectacle rotating and warping, dreamlike in front of me. Punctuation is critical to bringing my attention up again, and I perceive the scene vibrating, rippling outward to all corners of space. A call, or maybe a warning, that there is little left to become in this world.

Another, more insistent drone signals another source of punctuation. A craven punctuation, not daring reach the peaks necessary to breach the walls of its circle. If it had something to say, the signal was buried long ago, caught in the event horizon of the trudging souls rotation. I momentarily give in to my paranoia, or maybe it is just to rend myself from the sadness of it. I’ve been to this place before, I realize. A dream that existed when I was a child. I learned about what awaits us on the other side of this life. I have heard this warning before. It does not wait. It does not advance. It just is. The darkness. It signals to us in a way that we can (but choose not to) understand. My bones feel the memory focusing inward, like a lenses focus light. The memory burns my insides, alerting my limbs. Just in time for a bell to wake my senses.

I am called back, not even noticing that the scene before me had vanished. A deep moan is a welcome distraction from my existential rediscovery. I feel a current, familiar and moody, lend itself to an unwelcome voice. I don’t know what it is saying, but I know that I don’t want it. I rebuke the voice, and I uncover the courage to reject the experience. This is not my future. This is not my darkness. By distinguishing myself from the other, I am able to clearly see my light. Any shadows cast are my own. They belong to me. The voice of the other is small and pathetic. Laughable! I fight it back with the aid of the current around me. Electricity and sound become water, flooding the cavern in which echo lies. Waves crash at my command, and I hear the voice no more. The water darkens. The waters calm. I hear the gentleness of the shapes meeting me. I hold tightly to the grounding current. I am holding too tightly! In a rush, the voice returns with intent. My entire heart is being bent to the will of a drum from above. I see the cavern walls rise around me as well. I can make myself big, if not for a brief moment. I can become more than this space again. I have done it before. I breathe and my bones don’t bend. They grow. They grow to fit the space of my own light. The signal has changed, but it’s no longer for me. It was for me, but no longer is. It will remain in my past. The chime again tolls. Somehow, it sensed the end of my trial (or perhaps my will). I am free. I am here. I can see where I was, and know that I have succeeded. I have remembered, and not succumbed.

Now I wait to forget, and remember again.
