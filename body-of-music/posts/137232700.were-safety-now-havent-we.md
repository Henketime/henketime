What you are about to listen to is twenty-two minutes and thirty-three seconds of safety tips from nowhere. Not only did this album seem to appear out of thin air, but the performers (as of today) are entirely anonymous. The way I understand it, each track carries a message of safety, but, as is my wont, I chose to attempt to close off my conscious mind and let the music hit me (regardless of any personal injury concerns). Unlike most albums that I have written about, none of these tracks flows into the next.

I must be dreaming. Sliding across a New York sidewalk like a mashup between a Beastie Boys music video and a halftone-speckled comic book. The heavy pulp page ripples and crinkles, weaving my hand in between the panels. I hear the city lapping around me, ebbing and flowing like vibrating water along a concrete beach. Caution. Vibrant colors abound across all street surfaces, and often indicate danger. Big foreshortened movements into a fisheye lens and clearly outlined across the page.

The tip of my tongue starts melding with my cheek. I’m dancing and the space is expanding and contracting with the bass. The reverberating voice is a hot breeze through the room. The duo pushing me to put my phone away is almost immediately creating a second space. The intruding duo teleporting in from 1920s radio. I am constantly jostled by these drunken shufflers. I accept it in order to focus on my own time. I’m expressing my love for the sound, and for the genre. I’m lit up by trace amounts of video game vibes that float through the air. 90s classics like Einhänder and Bust-A-Groove are sparkling beside me while I try to ignore the Cuphead on the other stage. The groove has got me though, like the first bars to a song that then insinuates itself in totality. There’s a great drum phrase that gets said after the snare build up that gets me bodily back into lockstep with where I want to be. The juxtaposition of being instructed to “pay attention” when I’ve taken a lifetime to be able to let go this much is giving me that congealing feeling on my insides. The truth is, though, “you gotta…pay attention”.

Oh snap. I can feel the beat preloading as the fire starts to build. There’s a crackle of wood and the heat finds my cheek. The trimmed <em>chlk</em> of the drum makes me want to be dangerous in my movement. The subdued nature of the moment pushes me to break out and climb the walls. There’s an emotional tugging here that reminds me of Jamie Foxx’s Fall For Your Type. It’s hard to be less than I am being urged to be, but I am also very pleased to be here right now.

I’ve never been surrounded by a stage, but the open field nature of the drumline and the sound moving all around me certainly makes me want to be. The choir of snares is the star for me, and it’s hard to spend my attention elsewhere. I love feeling the texture overlaid on other conventions of the big pop genre. There’s a little old-timey patriotic flair there in the break and it has me imagining a space between now and then. I am kept in a high through the song, and then it ends.

There’s a crisp snap in this loop that keeps it fresh, rejuvenating my pulse. There’s a great texture here too that really resonates with me! It gives me a very wonderful vibrating wave through my arms and across my chest. The low-end complements it by turning my body into an antenna. The complement of high and low frequency is strong throughout and the reverb puts me in a neon cityscape. The tension ratchets up, but I know this is my home. The way the sound echoes off of the city are a dialect and I am a native speaker. The horizon is my classroom.

What’s that?

What’s that?

There’s a deceptively small space to this reverb-heavy soundscape. An orchestra comes in out of nowhere. A large room without a point feels like a missed opportunity. Like a graduation speech from a dickhead. I know that I’m floating, and I’m getting a little itch behind my eye. There is hope here, but I can’t seem to see it. It’s the sense of hope. A physical feeling of hope, as opposed to an emotional feeling of hope. My eyes start to droop…drowsy, but not tired. Alert and comfortable. The space is a place for reverberation. The echoes create a looney tunes sort of shell as a backdrop behind the main stage. I can tell that I’m about to leave the space, but I don’t know if I want to or not. I’ve grown comfortable, and now the thought has left me uncomfortable. But before I know it…That’s All Folks!

Thank you for coming along with me, and, as always: take my words with a grain of salt; do your own research; and be careful.
