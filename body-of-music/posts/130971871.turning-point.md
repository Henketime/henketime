Nothing hits like a swell. Nothing calms like a texture. And nothing is all that nothing can be. For forty-one minutes and eleven seconds, Turning Point will warn you of this. What is the purpose of this destructive time spent in sound? What waits for you on the other side?

Before I can even complete my thought, I feel a train float in from somewhere I know I’m not supposed to be. My body stiffens up a bit straighter than I was, or rather, is pulled up. The rhythm hidden in the texture of the call licks my spine. I board without boarding, my trepidation dissolving into a sudden warmth. I hear the whistle cry, connecting to my emotion at an intersection strange yet familiar. An unexpected romance bolts like a frightened horse going home. Adventure waits. I hear gears churn and coal burn as the beat from the train floor underfoot turns and swells. The cabin around me begins to fluctuate slowly and what was once organic starts to bend and grow.

I am seated but have not sat. My legs begin to dissolve as my own pulse fuses with the dream like vibrations of the machine. I shake them free so as to untangle myself from the pulsing texture. The shapes of sound become a part of the locomotion. Thrusts and lurches ring out into the darkness. The familiar whistle of the train signals a yearning for a distant destination. I too begin to feel it. The ceiling pings, reflecting a sudden kachunk in sound echoing from the tracks below. Suddenly, there is no floor underneath me, and I cling to the seat like a snake to quicksand. A reassuring brush reaches out, drumming over my body from left to right and then left again. It sends a soothing signal to my anxiety that I resist insistently. It pushes against my physical boundaries, not telegraphing its state, but wholly transferring its intent.

The whistle of the train becomes more confident. Does it see something in the gloom surrounding us? My confidence doesn’t last, as I begin to hear the banging of the tracks again, only this time, I see nothing below us. I close my eyes, not in fear, but because I know they can no longer serve me. The lurching subsides, resolving into a measured spine-like travel. Up and down, up and down, all the while each crest has its own troughs, and each trough rises and falls even deeper. I feel myself stretching out like a comb riding taut, feeling each note of a piano roll before it feels me. Underneath my width, the roll has become a kind of crystal, and I divine a digital message but cannot figure out the meaning. Try as I may, I can only recognize that it wants to calm me…no, it wants me to be calm. It doesn’t speak my language, and I sense desperation pushing against my growing anxiety. I want to tell it my secrets, as I too desire calm, but it can’t understand. Two incompatible entities signaling futilely to one another in the dark.

I give in to the fact that I am unable to escape the ride, and so whatever time I have is less important to me. I exist as one who can only hope. Of course, hope without reason is still hope. I am, once again in quiet. My eyes closed, not tightly, but resignedly. I know that a warm wind is blowing around me, but it dare not touch my skin, for I have calmed. I sit floating at the center of an empty car, seeing nothing, hearing nothingness. My body feels the sound far more than my ears can tell. The light past my eyelids grows brighter, but I don’t care to see. I am space. The emptiness travels over me. The light, through me. I have brought so much into this trip, even though I didn’t come voluntarily. My heartbeat rises through my body once more, making an involuntary declaration of malcontent. From out of the exact center of my heart erupts a single-toned, mournful whistle. And, like an animal being marched to the inevitable, I release a primal tone, lowing metallically for longer than I thought possible. My heart expands, reaching out, content at finding nothing. My walls again fluctuate between what I was and what I am becoming. The bell has tolled, and the chime has chimed. My last drum beats its final beat. I am a ray, infinite, and outside of time. I remember once having an end, a destination. Was I a fool? Was my hope misplaced, or is the never-ending somehow more significant than what comes after fear? Either way, something tells me I will be past caring when I learn. Truth only matters to those with the will to carry it out. Without slowing, I feel an added weight. I have picked up a new passenger. I must ready a compartment.

As always, take my words with a grain of salt, do your own research, and be careful.
