Inspiration is not real. We convince ourselves that it is because we crave definition. This is called that, this came from that, I am going here. Our energy is still our greatest mystery. We have failed to define it, and as such, it is where we spend it. We spend our energy going toward a definition. Toward the unknown. Whether you believe me or not, please do me a favor: try <em>not</em> to define Trying Not to Try by Emme Phyzema. Breathe and stay still. If you feel your energy increase, do not ask where it came from, and do not think about where it will go.

I am being towed by my foot across brambles and sand and dust. The steady song of my unseen engine’s boots rings dully on the hardened earth. An unwelcome band accompanies and seems to notice as I wake up. Then: chaos. I break free amidst the turmoil and run, stumbling into a nearby alley. I try to steady my breathing, but my chest won’t stay in. There lurks a menace from seemingly everywhere. The band catches on that I am hiding, and plays a jester’s tune for an unseen audience. I press myself against the wood planks masquerading as a wall on the nearside of the alley, and I pour myself through the cracks where mold makes its home. Some kind of stringed instruments insinuates its vibrations into my skull, bypassing my natural defenses. Now the sound comes from everywhere and a high-pitched instrument twangs to the ground in front of me. I can tell what I must do is dangerous because the band tells me so. I hear a whistling scream coming from the tracks leading out of town. I pluck the crystalline coil from the floorboards and give it to myself. Immediately, I feel myself growing; manifesting something primal. I erupt from the building like a foot from an ill-made shoe. I know that I don’t have to run, but I am compelled to any way.

I want to be safe, but no amount of wanting will allow it here. I see no destination, but know that I am not welcome where I began. I run, but the earth twists and chunks apart under my girth, turning the ground into a labyrinth of stairs and crumbling roots. I run organic shapes through the fictile stone maze. I can’t tell if I have shrunk back to my regular size, or am still a giant among ever more towering scars in the parched earth. A bird’s whistle echoes but doesn’t reveal its source to me, so I am shackled to my dysphoria. Rising from everywhere, the band takes chase again, playing their mocking instruments down each stair, and across each expanse. Inevitably, I trip down a staircase, my muscles giving way to gravity’s oppression.

In the temporary stillness, I see a light glowing from  around the corner. A light to break the terrible inorganic monotony. My body seeks headlong into the corridor to discover the light’s source, and what I find defies description. I can only describe the shadows it spewed on the walls. Before I looked away, I saw afterimages of towering, bubbling arcs and bridges. Pulsating shadows casting a play of some troubled nightmare. The energy is undeniable. They reach around the walls of the room and I have no choice but to run through. I find a small crawlspace into which my next terrifying adventure begins.

The ground is shaking with the pulsing masses mutating dance. I go as quickly as possible, and begin to find my rhythm inside me. My numb body lucks into a pace that feels almost effortless (were it not for the pain in my chest). I see a bird ahead at the exit, and it reminds me that I am huge. I muster the strength and stand from my knees, smashing the narrowing corridor around me. My head and chest taste daylight and dust and spit. I can see the tracks ahead of me, as the bird joins my quest, circling around my head as I tear, bodily, across the plain ahead of me.

My numb limbs are cooled by the burning sun, but they can’t silence their screams of protest any longer. I grab my thighs and use my arms as a sort of pneumatic component of a faltering engine. I am finally seeing the end, and it is providing me with a euphoria unlike any I’ve experienced. Joy without apprehension. My life becomes a straight line with only one objective. Obstacles be damned, I have no options! The air around me rings with the song of my will. I hear and speak the language of destiny. I am no longer running toward the end, I am pumping my legs to spin the entire world, bringing the end to me. I spread my arms out wide and enjoy the infinity between now and then. This moment is all I need. The escape is the end. I breathe again and my chest quiets. I close my eyes and everything collapses into a singularity. The moment in all its glory combines with my form and my perception. Dust to dust. Ashes to ashes. Returning to the signal that spawned me, chased me, called to me, and ends me. I am the point of origin of rays, and the destination of light. Escher saw this through his eyes. Dali picked it up through his antennae. Bosch’s brush feared it. Oppenheimer became it.

All of all the stars are within us all. Our beginning and our end. Our dreams and the source of the unknown which drives us forward. Drives us away. The band plays, understanding how to harness the energy. The band plays: not running; not looking away; becoming a conduit for pure energy. The holes in the night sky reveal the penetrating light behind the curtain. Watch as they all run around, connecting imaginary dots. See how we churn and toil the cycles. We make them go faster, but the band plays. We make them go faster. I spin and I spin, without destination and full of bliss. My arms wide, and my mouth open in song. I have opened my perception beyond the capacity for my form, and it comes exits unfiltered through my mouth. Drums through my skin, strings around my chest, and light from everywhere.

Thank you for coming along with me, and, as always: take my words with a grain of salt; do your own research; and be careful.
