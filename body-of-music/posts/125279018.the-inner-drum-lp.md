The Inner Drum LP is a voice. The djembe is a voice. The shaker is a voice. The plank over the hole dug in the ground becomes a voice if you have the will to stomp.

So many voices. Velvet and silk. Earth and air. Water sloshing, vibrating the container back and forth…and I too am shifting. Is this a party as claimed by Afronaut Zu &amp; Amo in the track Inner Drum? Or is it an impossible urge to sway to the rhythm of the world around you? Do I ever dance? What a question! To me it feels like a challenge, and before I know it, I prove to myself that I do. I dance from the inside out. A frenetic dance which emerges from my chest and inspiring my limbs follow like hypnotized snakes. In retrospect, I probably look hilarious, but I am still joyful. I am into love. Good god am I into love!

The texture pulses like elastic possibility. It doesn’t matter which way I move, I am always expanding, always right. I am moved. Do I have agency, or am I an agent? Have I become another tic-tic-boom alongside the tss-tss-tss? At the risk of invoking Auntie Donna, I ask “is my heart a drum?”. Another wall of noise overtakes me, rich with the flavor of 2fox’s vibrating caress. I am reminded of words from before my birth, long suppressed by responsibility:

This is a chance (this is a chance)
To dance your way
Out of our constriction

My memory of Funkadelic layers on and around Afronaut Zu’s firm grasp. Songs join songs join songs. I am in a safe space without borders, without end. The bass and the shaker will imprint and embed themselves inside whatever radiant force compels me to move. If I have power, I will move. I will swish and I will bounce. I will play, flowing without scrutiny. The space comes from within, and I am a magnet for the infinite. Accepting without acknowledging. What a heart, my heart!

Everything is many. The sheer fractal volume within the smoothness is overwhelming. Crisp echoes which stretch back from before I knew the sound. Omnidirectional but still ours. I am slowly brought back, signaled by the welcoming reach of space. All things end, and after 40 minutes and 17 seconds (73 and a half minutes with remixes) repetition and familiarity signal my discovery of the end. I accept, and I acknowledge. I notice that I am actually tired. Part of my lifeforce willingly given to the eternity that I have lived inside the music. My heart beats inside me and I am comforted that I will be renewed. I will regenerate because of the drum.

As always, take my words with a grain of salt, do your own research, and give care.
