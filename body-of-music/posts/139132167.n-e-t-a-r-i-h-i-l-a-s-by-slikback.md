I am enamored by Slikback. He makes music that creates incredible space. He makes movement from super dark textures. He makes music that makes me happy. Every time I try to get my head around what makes it all work, my body jostles my brain from my skull and I don’t care to find it. I completely lose myself in the heart of the work. I stop wanting to create, and I create. Aside from meeting Slikback in person, I can’t imagine a more significant connection.

Welcoming may not be the precise word for the mouth of the trail ahead, but I feel I’ve prepared. I have gone through the wood before, and endured the hard lessons of youth. This space feels internally familiar. It’s been waiting to be shaken free from my marrow matrix. And shake goes my body. The strings seem to create a motionlessness inside me, but the vibration is too real. Like a rolling shutter, what appears to be a glacial amplitude is simply moving outside of perception. This music is moving on a new axis. The anticipation of what’s next is only real in my head and my body knows. It’s already happening. Before it ends I take a breath. The oxygen in my lungs has to sustain me through what comes next.

I turn my attention to the insects outside. The industrious ant does ki’s work. Ki’s abdomen drags heavily on the dirt. It shares the sound of the earth with m. Food is scarce, and we’re waiting for the rain that is held back by nothing. While we go hungry, we band together, we cry, and we suffer. We call out our protest, and before we set our jaw we wonder who is listening. A tower is being erected from the earth in an attempt to reach an answer. I would know who is listening. I would climb through the sky.

As I prepare, the silhouette of this crude edifice outlines a truth about this life I’m leaving. There is not only danger in action, but danger in inaction as well. I feel my heartbeat supplemented by something other. Desperation or depravity, it would be nice to know, but my body doesn’t want my brain interfering any more. The time to act is now. Every sound on my ascent scratches, and my discomfort unmoors me. Buffeted by shrapnel and raised by the heat of the earth, I float, fighting the stinging sky. It tearing away my protection layer by layer. I focus on my skin, my limbs, my joints; strategically flexing muscles to keep myself intact. Raw and exposed, my only armor now comes from what’s inside me. My heart beats in time with my own wild flailing. I keep my own time as I grind. Higher and higher now, not only am I closer to answers, but bigger than answers as well. I see the light below me warming me, as it should. Why should the light heat the earth? My grip strengthens around the spire and my limbs rejoice at the rest. My new profound hierarchy heals me, and reinvigorates my body’s mission.

I hunger and I climb for my spirit’s food, ready to take everything. I can barely see the ground any more. Everything below is small, and the wind in my ears is the only thing that I feel. Dots moving and blinking out. Clouds are forming below me, obscuring the little things, and I am happy to not see them any more. My future is up and through. The sun and the wind beside, and the earth has been left behind. Nothing is easy, and my unease is the proof. My hunger reminds me of what I used to be. I had nothing, and now I see everything. My hands work my ascent heavily pooling metal links far below me. I bound in furious leaps.

My movements are lurching, no longer out of desperation, but out of habit. Fluid leaps up precarious ledges, no longer questing for answers, but simply stealing the next hold, and the next hold, and the next hold. I take the wind and whip it around my shoulders. I take the sun and put it on a ring around my head. I have my mantle and crown.

I reach a gate, but the gate is just a toy. Sticks sitting upright in the mud. I leave the gate untouched, and pass over, laughing at the child who left it here. I feel the connective tissue in my body begin to tighten as I rend the veil behind the gate. My fingers and toes dig in, and I don’t taste it as I gnash the membrane through with my teeth. The petty children try to keep the animal out! The weight of my whole body breaches the protective meniscus and I am through. I feel the treasure all over. My roots shake and my crown glows. I drape myself over what I’ve found and, at last, I become the bounty. How small it feels in the expanse of my chest. How great I feel up above. My gravity bows everything below. The tides come and crash, then go and muster forth again as I rock, pivoting upon this rock. What fun I will have with these things below. What fun I see in my toys, and their toys, and their toys’s toys. I can hear them now.

Thank you for coming along with me, and, as always: take my words with a grain of salt; do your own research; and be careful.
