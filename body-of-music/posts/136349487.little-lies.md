I’m trying something new today, so stick with me, you brave souls, you. I continue my search to experience music in new and exciting ways, and until mixologists invent drinkable albums, we only have each other. I’m trying out a way to transcribe the bodyfeel of a single song. Normally, a song is too short for a satisfactory transcription, but I thought: what if I listen to the song a hundred times(ish) on repeat? Watch David Spade saying “roads” until it loses all meaning in “Black Sheep” and see how many times it takes for you to replicate it with a word of your choice. In honor of Spade, Farley, and Wolf, I’m calling this experiment “songsongsongsong”. If you want to listen to the embedded video below, right click on the video, and make sure “Loop” is checked. On to the transcription.

I used to carry the album Tango in the Night by Fleetwood Mac in a Discman to high school. Every day for almost an entire year, I would tote it alongside a brown paper bag and have a listen&nbsp;and a lunch. Little Lies was my favorite track, and I don’t think I can tell you why. It has a simple, beautiful melody, but it’s got gusto and gravitas. In my memory, it is also a bit sad, and feels, maybe, like a hug goodbye. Memories, however deeply dug, will change with time. And what you used to know so well, will return as something else entirely, if they return at all.

During my initial listen, the inorganic nature of the opening notes puts me in a sharp and linear room. The bells and chimes combine freely, providing soft energy as the room populates. I become aware of layers of sound around me like insulation, or pancakes around a me sausage. The dimensionality is staggering. The punctuation of the drums is dulled and seems to effervesce. The pulses of sound provide a truer rhythm. The stage is taken by an overwhelming number of voices. It is one when quiet, and then legion to drive home the point. The fade out feels like the illusion of a conclusion of the endless.

My emotions are already getting the better of me. I’ll try to describe them simply. I am happy to listen to Little Lies, but I am sad to hear Little Lies. This song walks me to joy, and this song leads me emptiness. Hm. Sweetness and sadness should never be paired, yet, they often are. We seek perfection but crave imperfection, so we create juxtaposition. Absolutes could exist if we wanted them enough. If it were only that simple, maybe I could bear something other than the saccharine sorrow.

At a certain point, I have lost the ability to recognize the song. The parts grew to gigantic proportions, and what would usually demarcate a verse from a chorus have disappeared. The tenor of the song belies its shifting nature. Chimes persist in the background, like a strobe of lights in a dark hall. There are noises here (I’m sure of it) that you can only hear if you give the song the entirety of your attention: a lowing voice coming from everywhere; a strange almost atonal chirp; a hooooaaah manifesting without having been strummed. There are puzzles here to solve, but it has become impossible to isolate anything without being beset by another. I’m snorkeling in glycerine. The voices wave in the triol compound like tall curtains. I can barely contain my joy every time I fail to name an instrument, yet each new realization brings a brief profound sadness. As if reading my mind, Christine tells me “no more broken hearts”, and I feel every intonation down my spine.

I see it now. There’s something inside the notes that is thick and telescopic. It peers into me, yet can pull and push me like a paper yo-yo. When I feel the tug, I wonder if I am being pulled or doing the pulling. This music lives in my belly, and reaches itself outward until it is a part of me. We move together, yet neither of us leads. The melody that I know intimately is the pathway connecting us. Yet, I know now, it serves to disguise an entire ecosystem of melodies. It’s the pumpkin hiding the guts of the overstuffed wicker horn. Each obscured melody, when drawn out, has its own unique voice and strange role to fulfill within the context of the music. Under scrutiny, some appear to be plucked, others wailed, still others are thum thum thummed gyrating around the undeniable luminary that is Christine McVie.

Christine’s voice is the nucleus of this rippling feast. In this impossibly cavernous amphitheater, all incidental sounds shimmy and shine in the periphery of our senses. Only one thing exacts your attention. The sensuous texture of the voice is something that the mind will never be able to serve on its own. The sensation of this potion grazing the inside of my ribcage is near-impeccable, but without Christine’s mystery, all other sounds would be without meaning. It’s strange how capriciousness can be an anchor. Slowly, the voice and I are connected by proximity. She sits me down and asks, proclaims, suggests, and implores something of me that I try desperately to understand. She coyly changes the volume and affect of her voice and I am enraptured. When she directs me to tell her lies, I don’t know what to do. I am absolutely blindsided by her overtures at the end of each sentence. I want to find the words that will make her unquestionably happy. For a distracting moment I realize that I’ve been here before with her. We always seem to get back to this point. I remember knowing that it would be different this time, and my entire being is telling me that we’re not actually here again. How could we be? We did everything differently. At least that’s what I’ve been telling myself. I am sure that I want to stay, her and I, together in this orbit. Repelling each other toward our sensual gravity is the only thing I’ve ever wanted for us. Sure it can be dangerous. If we can’t read each other we will surely crash in the center, or spin wildly apart. I don’t want to see the contradictions in my mind. I pretend not to hear them clattering against the inside of my head. But what are the lies that we tell ourselves? If we’re each telling lies, how will we ever know what is true? Is it even safe to speak? The voice and I finally part after passing an unspoken wisdom. The sweet little lies have to be taken in order to soften the truth.

Thank you for coming along with me, and, as always: take my words with a grain of salt; do your own research; and be careful.
