Paying attention to things is risky. We commit what we observe to memory, and by doing so we make ready patterns that we will (probably) apply to future situations. During my forty-four minute and thirty-three second listen to THE CURSE OF COLONIALISM II, I paid attention to the communications of a complete stranger. What did I find out? All things must end. I don’t know what that means, to be honest, and I don’t know whether it’s important or not. My patterns have already recognized and my biases have reacted. Should I work to find out if they were right? I would have an easier time recreating Michelangelo’s David, or reaching the sunset.

My favorite flavor of ice cream travels slowly down my chin. It’s cold, but not wet. It refreshes me as if through osmosis. What a beautiful world this is. The color of my perception changes from chaotic infinitude to the perfectly paired grays and pastels of nostalgia. I get to go on a trip today. The horizon cuts a perfectly even groove as it revolves around me. The air gets a little cooler, and the sky is a cloudless gradient of warm colors. Each twinkle in the sky is a chime being rung in time. The soundwaves undulate across my sonic panorama. The shape of the drum matches the shape of the sway. There is an ever present noise, which plays a comforting terrestrial role, keeping me tethered to this ripe diorama.

I feel a glass shell has been placed over top this scene. A perfectly blown cloche, keeping the sound inside sharp, but my vision blurred toward the horizon. Everything vibrates back and forth, buffeting me in place. Smoothly up and down, left to right in concert. The simple beauty of my surroundings cannot be denied (as if I’d want to). Polygonal palm trees with bases coated in a dark matte ink. The sun from the distant horizon should be casting long shadows, but every shape holds a hovering diffuse darkness. Each element’s forms and details appear separate from one another. No matter how cohesive it all appears, no matter how right it all feels, the aesthetic still serves to distract me from something. I shake off my paranoia. It doesn’t really matter here. I’m able to appreciate the form of these well-crafted things. That’s what matters. All the shallow textures work to unify me with the world. The smoother it is, the easier it will go down. A very astral bass note feels like it’s opening the space in between my feet. I think it’s time for me to sit down. I can’t hold on, and I realize it’s better to stretch out my legs. I lay there, motionless, and I allow the vibrations to take my breath away.

So many subtle rhythms mask a greater movement. Coarse, like a world moving across an ocean. I hear myself breathe for a brief moment, and I get to see the sky. The familiar ombré from the horizon, but it appears slightly concave, warped in a way that would have been otherwise unnoticeable. The sky above is too close and far too shallow. Even the texture of the clouds seems rolled out somehow. I hear voices, and my curiosity tells my brain to ready the sweat. Surrounded by theses textureless palm trees, I see that a jungle has sprung up around me. How did I not notice? On my knees, I touch the ground. The bass still pulses, and now the horns play when I need them to quiet. The sound is truly alluring. I look around to find the source, but can see only the uniform corrugation of the plasticky palms rise around me. Climbing to the top of one such tree, I peer out across space. The sunset glares at me, like before, but it no longer sheds any light on the matter. The world has dimmed around me. I sense a cool glow somewhere out of sight. A shaft of blue insinuates itself across the sky like a white lie. I search around and, although everything is darker, I get distracted by its strange glamour. I don’t want to climb down to be a part of this jungle. The allure of treetop gazing is the bass guitar, and its coupled distortion. A guitar flanges downward in a never-ending cascade of warmth down my chest. I can feel the love come to me from everywhere. A shaker and a click. A swoo and an aaah. A horn and its friend the flute slowly bring me down and put my feet squarely at the center of the world. Zero x, zero y, and zero z are my coordinates.

The streets of this faceless city pulse in time with my head nod. What a great feeling it is when you are in control. I throw my arms out to the side, and the streets gets wider. The sax solo plays me in as I prepare to groove. I stretch my legs and walk the avenue, but I don’t move. No, the world moves, and I am its engine. Beneath my feet gravity bends and everything and everyone turns. I slide, shimmy, and groove my way in a straight line (straightened, of course, by my will and my vector). The chimes and keys signal the end of a tune, and indeed they are correct. I have coerced this plastic pastel paradise to push itself to the edge of the scene.

I have made it flush against the painted horizon. It towers above me like a big brother, but I don’t need it any more. I peel the orange and pink paint with my fingers, clawing with my hands. I remove one of my plastic sandals, the lip made sharp by creating friction in a frictionless world. I plane the makeshift tool against the convex surface. Beneath, I start to infiltrate a secret that becomes too big to forget. Each chip makes way for a wash of intense blue light. It takes a moment for my eyes to adjust, but I make out distant blurry forms. Creatures which are alien to me. The sounds around me begin echoing uncomfortably, as I am clearly outside of optimal acoustic areas. The drums seem to glitch and rasp. The lead dips in and out of fidelity. I am clearly not meant to be here. I force myself to continue looking behind the sunset. The contours of the figures are arranged regularly in a sort of seance, or observatory. I strain to listen as the music fades away. After a moment of silence, the drums arrive like a cloud.

The crisp coolness touches my cheeks like a mother’s hand. I close my eyes so I can remember better. There…. I can look around comfortably now. I have all the space I need. Another beautiful horizon greets me with cool colors as does the gentle sound of water. I breathe deeply and open my eyes to greet my friend the shaker. Ah the shaker. All around me is glorious sand. Trees, water, and the vibrant makings of a good life. I look in my hand, and, wouldn’t you know it, I’ve already picked up a shell. It’s beautiful, obviously. Pink and orange on the inside. The outside is completely translucent and dark, like glass. When I look through the glass, I see straight through! I don’t even see the colors on the other side of the shell. I put it up to my eye, and I can see everything around me with crystalline clarity. What a funny shell. I look at my hand through it’s dark lens and it looks absolutely perfect. I could stare at myself through this glass forever. Oddly enough, it smells like it hasn’t come from the sea. Everything should touch the water. I reach back my arm, and release it, and all my worries, into the rhythm and flow of the sea.

As always, take my words with a grain of salt, do your own research, and be careful.
