Well here we are again. Something I love about Bandcamp is its “SELLING RIGHT NOW” ticker. It’s a beautiful idea, and if anyone from the team who came up with it ever reads this: thank you. I initially thought it was something to display how successful the platform is, but I think it’s something else entirely. You see, whenever someone spends more than the asking price on an album, the ticker relays that information. In the case of Moonlight Amnesia by Helen Stellar, it said “$8 more than the minimum”. When I first got an account for Bandcamp, I started something called “Bandcamp Sniping”, wherein I watch the ticker and open each album that sells for 5 USD (or equivalent) more than the minimum and compile a list of new music. This is no ordinary list of new music, as you have probably figured out. This is a list of music that someone has decided was worth more than what was being asked. An album that someone deemed more valuable to them than expected. What better tool to help determine which albums to try? If you look back at previous transcriptions, those tagged with “Sniped” are albums that follow this pattern. I highly encourage you to give it a shot. If you do, please share the method (and the found album).

My chest expands and my eyes immediately move rapidly behind my closed eyelids in the dark room. I’m not fighting anything and my body coalesces in and out of movement. Exuberant sonic explosions spur on my coordinated contractions. Notes travel in and out of noise with the training of fighter jets in formation on a summer day. The sound changes in predictable ways, reassuring my instinct to comfort. I sing along with my heart to a song about accidental love and turbulent emotions. Major keys and telegraphed interactions. I feel like it’s okay to feel happy. I am taken back to my youth, working in a comic book shop, when the music begins to unexpectedly fade out. A transition that reminds me maybe I’m not ready for what comes next.

A bassline enters bouncing around the ground like a child’s toy. A bodyless narrator chimes in from outside the fence line. I feel hope amidst the trepidation of this voice. There is level of powerlessness that is being communicated, but it’s an understood powerlessness. A measured distance from someone struggling to stand. The kind of teetering confidence of being a parent or a partner. My body has yet to stop moving. I feel that I understand with my brain what this heart proclaims. My heart feels it too. There is knowledge that gets passed by unique emotional transmission whether the communications are intentional or not. I’ve seen the subtle twitch of the hand, or the forward set of this jaw, and it has revealed to me something intimate. There’s no need to keep it inside if you have the support of loved ones, but even though there are none to be found here, there is enough to feel safe.

The swift strumming of steel guitar strings feel like softly petting hands down my cheeks. I am coming home and I’m imagining my first embrace. There is a rhythm to it in my mind. It sways left to right with my heartbeat. I squeeze tighter as the time ticks harder. I feel the magnetism in my fingertips bending space between us. I may not get to hold you, but this inward orbit feels like it will always be enough. I remember you then, and I see you now. Every chance I get to close my eyes is a blessed return to your gravity. I feel you squeeze my shoulders into my ribs, and I pull your bones into mine. I breathe and you breath. I sigh and you exhale. Everything out and everything in.

The steadiness of the noise drives me along the highway. The sky shows me lights in a steady pattern that makes me want to take the top down and drive slower. There’s a resistance in the air that is intentional. I am being reminded that the music is there. The music that lives underneath reality. The music that leads our heartbeats by the hand. I feel it on my arm as I thump the side of the car. My hand is a sail parting and darting through the permeating signal. You can feel it too, I see. I look over to see you fully and you are smiling, and I am smiling. I look to the horizon and I am glad that I can’t see past it. I can’t see anything but this moment. I open my hand to grab a scoop of life and my arm shoots back. I laugh and we continue to dance along with the night sky. Trails in front of us and trails behind the song of the night. They are one, and we are one with them. I breathe in and my lungs are filled with tomorrow, and the vitality of forever with you.

Thank you for coming along with me, and, as always: take my words with a grain of salt; do your own research; and be careful.

-Kevin
