This album came to me from a subscriber. I am super pleased that I get to experience something new from your something old. Please send more, and I’ll get to them as I can.

That said, I don't know what to expect, and ten seconds in, I'm already correct. Who knows what you’ll hear when this one reaches you! Some things that struck me about the last thirty-five minutes and thirty-six seconds of my life are that this album drew resources out of me that I have completely forgotten I had. Musical, yes, but also experiences that played upon me like strings and voices and pans. I was reminded that I have lived a life, even if work has monopolized my language. I grew up inside Youth Lagoon’s Heaven is a Junkyard in a way that I hope you can experience.

The drums hit in ways that feel assembled wholly by hand. The bass from the drum, the guitar, and the keys make it known that I am already in deep. Why were they doing that? It's a great question. How is the sound so bright? Everything feels dark against my skin, but my brain is telling me otherwise. I haven't had the chance to understand, but I feel something important has already happened. A headline of an abandoned paper on the coffeehouse corner-table. I walk away slowly thinking I should have paid closer attention. The piano lies and says it's not important. I can come back any time to read it agin, but it's already gone, so I move along. There is honey spiked with bitter salt dripping down my organs. So sweet, and hiding something tough and dark. I feel a bassful brush and a rasp across wet wood. Sadness in the water, but I'm bone dry. Slathered in heavy air. The beat advances steadily, and I am ready to greet it chest to chest. This time I know it’s important. I try to listen, focusing with intent, still l struggle to understand. Now I want it too much, I fear, and the song ends again with a whisper of what was.

My mind still has yet to successfully parse the verse, and the chorus hits hard. It carries with it all the sunshine and glamour of an old gas station. An echo of an echo and then disorienting silence. The song brushes across my stomach and changes the shape of my skin in a way that makes me grateful. I ripple and shimmer along with it. My need for the gravity of this music wells up slowly like a ceremony. I hear it, I feel it, and I know it will last. My skin begins to sag and age and I see the beauty in time inside of a thing. Youth keeps tethered to a history jettisoned by its parent.

And just like that, a child comes into view, running after something out of view. Maybe trying to find a lost toy, but not fearing for the lost, and not lamenting the search. It's over too soon, just like everything else.

Behind me, I can feel the bark of an old tree. Vibrant and sun-loved. The sun reaches out to everything with the force to make something useful. I want to bring it all together inside me, but the earth under me lets me know not to be greedy. There's enough to go around, and what has taken its fill still makes a home for others. Like the rays of the sun, some words hit me, and other pass through me. I can’t take it all in, but I can still cherish the strings of a piano, drawn tight, vibrating in space.  Knowing these sounds is the deteriorating recollection of memory. Like the tape of an old recording stretched thinner and thinner from each play. I am drawn out too and can feel my own weight.

I feel the weight of the sun’s job impress the world. Pushing, tightening, moving. I feel us improving. Even the healthy get better. A chorus seems young and old across my vision. So huge, but clearly coming from two points on the horizon. And just when I forget about the love that got me here, I remember the truth it bears on it's shoulders. What if I use my weight and bend the ground beneath this burdened love so that it never has to walk uphill again? I push harder moving ten paces in front of the words, and stay ten behind the music. I laugh, realizing, finally, that I am the reason that I can’t understand the words. I crunch the rocks beneath my weight to create a softer gravel path for what I know are words of pain and proof. I don’t need to understand them, I tell myself. The words are always in the right place to push me forward. I stay too with the music. It guides me like a single firefly in a dark wood. I know where it is even when it's not there. I anticipate, and hear a silent call. It pulls me along on a single thread and my heart soars effortlessly towards it.

Earth calls again. The feet of a thousand boots keep time, causing inspired destruction, but it's only just enough to keep pace. We see, in the field ahead of us, another form of inspired destruction. Another slick lie coated in the viscera of man, wrapped in a suit. Shapes change and the horns suddenly sound better. I know better, and I know the trap. A devil from the country indeed. A slick hello, a staged gesture of weakness, and a killer smile. Someone gets savvy, and we wonder how late is too late. A story for another time, perhaps, and we’re already looking forward toward the next story.

Time wants us to understand it while we continue to work beating feet across the earth. It winds a tree through the night's sky. The leaves grow, at first altering the moonlight with their translucency, then taking the moonlight for themselves. No, not taking…fulfilling. The purpose of each moon-soaked leaf is a handshake made long ago. A coupling for the ages. The bountiful light of the sun reflecting off a body so distant that it is beyond the reach of flight. The leaves greet the moon as only they can. The winding trunk continues in a rhythmic rocking, in and out reflecting the gravity of the love of luna and leaf. A love their ancestors passed down, unspoken, for a length of time that is out of reach of our comprehension.

History sometimes feels new. Ancient moments show up like impossible fountains. I am captivated by the infinite in all of us, and I have captured something infinite from these songs.

As always, take my words with a grain of salt, do your own research, and be careful.
