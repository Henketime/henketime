“The tingling means it’s working”. I think that was a Sensodyne slogan, or some other “super extra-strength” shampoo from my childhood. Musically, there are very few instruments that universally elicit that response from me. I will get goosebumps while listening to Jeremy Dutcher sing in the language of his ancestors. The sound of Sonny Terry’s wailing harmonica will replace my blood with pure signal. I feel a whispering shock migrate across my body when I hear Steve Hendrickson’s trumpet linger and fade across the walls of a chapel. These same instruments placed in most other people’s hands can not yield the same bounty. So why then is it that, no matter the context, no matter the origin, no matter the performer, I am universally awakened by the bass drum kick? Is it a blessing or a curse? I’ll never know, but at least I know what this tingling means.

I and still and listening in darkness. I am stirred by a hundred soft-bodied things, like blueberries, bouncing off my chest. A beautiful rich tempest beats across me, cascading down and pouring out across the stone where I lay. I open my eyes with the wakefulness of the resurrected, and remember that my shoulders are the stone. As I wake, my energy ripples out across the landscape. If you hear it, you know that I am being called, but my call can be heard too. I gently twist my upper body and the stone and grass twist underneath me, reaching out seismically over the beckoning cliffs. The echoes of my movements mean new life, and the grinding of the dead. I feel liberated as I sit up, pulling the roots and rocks and rivers beneath me free. I breathe deeply and the air is cool, but as I reach my feet, I realize my skin is hot. I look slowly to my left and spot a large body of water beyond the cliff. The animals at my feet have become frenzied, and, even though they don’t yet know it, they move toward the water.

I whisper the words that have lain dormant in my lungs, and rain spews forth. A dark, muddy rain, full of lightning and gravity. My heart beats an intimate message of connection to the source through my feet. My movement remains a steady predictable cadence, but loose and free. The organic material of my body begins to loosen around me. I say goodbye to the elements that had cradled me. As I raise my arms I pierce the sky and feel the bracelets of immaterial cold climb my arms downward. I am quenched, but the hot life around my feet becomes impossible to ignore. Their frenzy is one of desire and love. They travel alongside me, and even though they wish not to change, but they know transformation is upon them. They start to think about what they want next. We move swiftly without moving quickly. We are one mind, connected in our vector and our origin. I touch my hands to my face and create something new pressed between the cold and the old. A spring under a mountain. Perhaps a cove underneath the world. There are places that we know of that we will never see, smell, feel or taste. We must always listen, and remain connected.

I decide to slow my pace for a moment, and listen to the world through the ears of life below me. I take a knee, and give a hand. Moving life flows around my giant mass in the shape of a yoni, and although only a few stay to commune, I feel each soul as it passes by me. We imbue each other with our marks in passing, each with our ears open. Life touching life is an unstoppable rhythm. Even closing your ears doesn’t stop the beat in your heart. The beautiful few impart warmth up into my core, and through our connection, I am able to renew their conviction. Desire without principle quickly becomes stagnant, no matter how much your cup can carry. Excitement croaks to the surface of my aura. I can feel each note of the call from each beat of each measure. It comes at me from an invisible tower all around me, providing cosmic inspiration. I rest as the beat rests before again getting to my feet.

I get to feel everything that is lighter than air bubble up over my body all at once. An effervescent signal reaches up from the source of my inspiration, and I feel the driving pulse again. It urges me on with what can only be described as a smile felt throughout my limbs. I marshal myself, this time wearing the inspiration on me, and in doing so I shake some of the bedrock off and it rolls down my back. I have almost reached the cliffs that first promised the water’s air to me. I imagine that I can hear the voice of the water come to me. I can certainly hear the pulse. It plays out as true as time before existence. As I arrive at the cliffs, I see the animals pooled, transfixed on what lies ahead.

As I step off of the cliff, I feel the air around me become more saturated. I don’t know what it is in the air, but it feels like it has been warmed, and cooled at the same time. This space has amplified every voice, including my own. My feet stomp the rhythm that drives the dance. The primal magic moves everyone forward through the air, and the lifeforms make their desires known. Some remain up high on the cliff, some march across the cliffs to the hills toward the source of the warmth. Others still move toward the darkness and the cold. I stay my course, and slowly glide toward the water. No one travels out of reach of the life-giving pulse from below, and no one desires their destination any less because of the absence of the other. Our connection remains, calling across in the eve’s dark backdrop. Distant stars connected by straight lines as every light pulses deeply. Pulsing connection.

Ending my dance on the coast with an exhale and a stomp, my limbs and trunk become lighter as tiny particles erupt downward in a twinkling shower. Mixed with the fire and water in the air, my earth creates something utterly complete. I feel ethereal. The rhythm that was resonating in me ripples slowly through my strange jelly body. The rocks, crystals, and dust of me has been given away. My time still pulses, but it also aches. I listen to the creatures, and, although they are far away, I can still hear them. I can still hear myself in them. I beat the slowing song out with my feet on the sand. As it fades, I see my new form reflected in the air around me. A shimmering everything I’ve never seen before. Backlit by the night sky.

As always, take my words with a grain of salt, do your own research, and be careful.
