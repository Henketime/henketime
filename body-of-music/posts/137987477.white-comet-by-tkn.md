I’m writing this intro a few days after transcribing my experience, and I want to share something interesting: I almost never remember the albums after I transcribe them. Personally, I think this is a sign that I’m doing something right. The sound flowed through my body and out my fingers so successfully, that it only existed in the part of my brain that stores sensory information. I remember wanting to write about the vocaloid singer in White Comet, but all of the pertinent data that would provide value is gone.

With that in mind, I’d like to personally hijack this intro and thank everyone with whom I’ve spoken about this project. I am excited to continue indulging myself, but with an refined approach based on your suggestions. My appreciation mostly goes toward all of the encouragement you’ve slathered me with. Not to get too schmaltzy, but this project has been instrumental in my understanding of <em>how</em> I love music. I’m drilling deep into my own psyche and I legit have no idea where I’m going, or what I’m going to strike into next. Thanks for fueling my engine, and coming along with me! I continue to hope that you join in and do some writing of your own, whether for you, everyone, or some set in between. Thanks kindly, and I hope to chat with you in the comments.

Bopping already and I feel the bump of the beat pressure my body from my left to my right. Brightly colored spheres in concentric circles around me are hopping along. The hop is contagious, and my thighs are sick with it. The gentle curves of the beat guide the tips of my extremities. They follow their shape like a dog follows waving bacon. A hole is opening in the sky and a glass vortex touches down in the distance. My curiosity is drawn to the sound, and I continue to bop, interested and carefree. The bass slides down like a dad at a waterpark, then dovetails into a whole new soundscape. New geometry arises, helping me smooth my movements.

Even though I’m being taught the nature of the objects teaching me make me question whether I’m alone or not. Surrounded by oscillating forms, but the character and warmth of the melody convince me that I’m only as alone as I want to be. A sound can call in a friend, or be reassuring if recognized. Its placement in time intensifies your vulnerability as if sound, too, is an emotion, overlapping to boost or nullify the waves of energy. Even silence can become a joy amidst the noise coming from within. I laugh, realizing that I still don’t understand most of what is happening right now.

Frenetic cascades of individual sounds marble together in a beautiful texture. I am either a 100-foot-tall waterfall of ice cream, or thousands of LEGO tires hitting the carpet. I challenge my setting confusion by remembering that understanding is something that we require of our physical space, not our emotional space. Our emotions are fine without mooring. When we say “our emotional center” we are labelling an intangible thing from the perspective of our three-dimensional world and worldview. The fundamental lack of mass of our “self” interfaces best with an unseen world: I can only learn something once; the act of remembering requires my full attention; fun isn’t fun when I’m thinking about fun.

My body has an impulse to move, and it emanates, in a pure way, from somewhere that isn’t here. I am what lies behind the curtain. The more I feel this, the more myself I feel. A build up of sound and energy comes together in an instant and brings me back to the front of the stage. My edges become the texture of the vocaloid. Enough of a whisper that I have to lift my hands to feel it on my skin. My breath catches and I’m told that there is someone who keeps the party going. Was he hired to do it? What a silly thing to think about. I stop caring when an array of <em>the familiar</em> surfaces organically across the landscape in front of me. Drops of water spike the earth, rising up into evergreens. I’m not walking, but the earth rotates toward me like a video game in attract mode. I’ve already got my quarter on the glass, but I’ll watch and watch without taking my turn. As far as I’m concerned, this demo can last the rest of my life if I just close my eyes.

Thank you for coming along with me, and, as always: take my words with a grain of salt; do your own research; and be careful.
