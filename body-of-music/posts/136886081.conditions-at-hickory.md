Being greeted suddenly by something unfamiliar produces the only rational fear we, as humans, possess. In that moment, reality metamorphoses from the known to the unknown in an instant, and we are forced to make a decision with little or no information. It is completely natural to freeze, and perhaps hope that the world freezes with us. Often times when I listen to albums blindly, I try to keep myself in the dark, information-wise (though, I also listen and transcribe in almost total darkness). For Dreamweather’s Conditions at Hickory, however, it was recommended to me by a reader and accompanied by a chat. The conversation we had spoke to our shared love, and fear, of the weather. And just like with the weather, the conversation helped me look forward to, and grow anxious toward, the 19 minutes that I am about to transcribe. Thank you for the recommendation, dear reader.

What greets me as I begin? My muscles are crystallizing like selenite along my bones before I can fully understand the song’s timbre. Wedging and passing through each other, sending shocks up my skin with each accidental collision. Like past lives intruding into hard times.

I don’t know this tune, but I know of it. Knowing “of” something indicates, but doesn’t reveal its origin. Knowing “of” something prevents you from asking revealing questions. This makes knowing “of” a thing the perfect spot to hide a lie. I am put on my heels, on guard against something that feels like a weapon, but looks like smile. A waving hand with too many fingers or a silhouette with teeth. A truncated future made out of bits of the past. This music is a quilt of veils. I can only see that I am being watched.

I hear a chirp, and it reminds me of the chirp I heard before. I didn’t think anything of it at the time, but I think it is definitely the same. I hear a kind of alert. Not one that I’ve heard before, but it sounds more than a little bit like an incoming fax. What do you do with an alert you receive while on hold? I laugh at my little apprehension. But, my heart beats a conflicting signal to me: be worried. I try to relax and let the music soothe me. I welcome the fact that it’s more calming than before. The teeth are still apart from the shadow, but now they too are behind a veil. The song actually finishes, and I feel relief. At least one conflict has been resolved. My body fights against my mind activating a swaying dance to the new rhythm in an attempt to override the steady increase of my heartbeat. I hear a piano that feels like waves traveling along the ocean floor. As I follow the sound along the seabed, I — fuck. The music cuts in and out, and I know what that means. My body wants to adapt, but instead freezes. The piano now seems like a prelude to disaster. I am alone at the bottom of the ocean, where I cannot move. Several more bones are felt in the dark as the signal continues to degrade and warp. The peaks of sound are sheared; evidence of past violence. Proof that someone didn’t want me to hear it. As I’m saying this to myself, the fidelity of the music jumps up in a macabre way. I can hear more, but it presents less. Two opposing gradients converging only to erase each other.

I hear sounds from a piano made of fingernails that careen down chalkboards. Most other instruments don’t accompany, but instead provide a hard scrabble against the walls of a barren waiting room. The conga reaches out as it is the only sound that does not grate against me like slow saw blades. The melody emerges, still familiar, but it has become decidedly contemptible. I stand pacing, waiting for it to end. I hope that it never does. I hope the calamity never comes to pass, but dammit I want out. The back of my mind is still chewing on this melody, and I stop short of gaslighting myself that I’ve heard this song before. Waiting for someone to check on my video rental, or watching the scroll for my local weather. As I’m wondering in exhaustion, the music cuts again.

Cats are mewling some amalgam country music and the fidelity plays games with me. Wavering between the 16-bit and 21st century. This music seems to know exactly what frustrates me. Conflicts go unresolved, melodies are almost hummable, and the quality of sound lurches sickeningly, tugging on the inside of my belly button. If I had something to see visually, maybe it would take some strain off of my ears and my body. As it is, this has become a marathon. Just when I think I have a moment to complain, I — again? Wow. Now there’s a literal tornado warning.

The entire low end of sound is preventing the lowest muscular relaxation. I’m being held, like a swordsman snatched up by the cyclops. Squeezed just enough to prevent me resetting my mind or my emotions. I can hear someone speaking now, but this damnable music is in the way of the details of the tornado warning. I’m straining to listen to the man’s voice, I am also far too invested in the music as it cuts in and out of signal and quality. The more noise I hear now the more I want to attach myself to the signal. I hear scratches and pops, and I hear the wind against a matchbox house. I’m down in the basement, because I know that’s where I’m supposed to be during a storm. I’m the only one here. Just the storm, the music, and me. As I get on my knees with my arms over my head, I understand that there are two storms, one of the body and one of the mind. I hear the space over my head being violently assaulted by wind, rain and debris. The music too scrapes against my mind. Soon I will have nowhere to go. Now I hear the storms roar. And now it is gone. The wait is over.

Thank you for coming along with me, and, as always: take my words with a grain of salt; do your own research; and be careful.

-Kevin
