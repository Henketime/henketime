Sleep deprivation is weird. Despite the volumes I’ve read on the subject, I have come across very few descriptions of the sort of time dilation that occurs while in the throes of wakeness. This is very different from not knowing what time it is…an affliction that I experience casually daily. When deprived of sleep, I am so zoomed in on the overlapping moments, that I actually don’t know if it is currently now. I have no temporal awareness: I don’t know if I’m in the middle of something or putting a bookend on it. If you’ve not experienced this, consider spending 22 minutes and 59 seconds with PLAY AUDIO. Whether accidentally or intentionally, this album meets this specific disorientation in the same way a crooked artist meets a warped canvas.

The moments after silence create scale without proportion. Presently, I feel like there’s a cavern inside of me that has come alive. Swirling motion triggering expanding state undulations. The ground around me becomes excited by a distant drone. Space-compacting and dropping everything lower. I can feel the air between the clumps of matter tremble, chattering softly like gums for teeth. Everything is without perspective, and, as such, the space between everything doesn’t feel real.

The meat around my bones stretches as my excitement grows. In the same way that communicating the indescribable will never be more than noise, considering the unfathomable will never be more than making space for darkness. When time and space become saturated with force, we prickle and expand. Then…wait.

Is absence the same as knowledge that something doesn’t exist? A silent wire passes through the horizon, letting nothing in. Reality eventually reconstitutes itself, but in the most conspicuous way possible…perfectly. Organic props and blocking. Composed out of pure matter. Shot by shot, frame by frame, I see no evidence of hand. In the moments vibrating like tracking lines across the scene, I fumble for something real. How can it be organic, if it’s been reassembled?

I look around and listen for what I couldn’t before. This entire scene has a richness of color that I didn’t know that I wanted. There is clay underneath every grain of sand. The wind in the nether spaces doesn’t blow, it haunts. The effort required to carry a single speck of dust is greater than any storm could muster. It passes through without touching anything.

I dismiss a voice whose inflected meaning careens past each syllable. Nothing sticks here. A beautiful fabrication whose purpose is only ever hinted at during the peace between movements. There is no malice here. Anything striving towards a goal will not linger. Any yearning thing doesn’t belong. A clock eventually needs wound, and so, time doesn’t exist. A song requires a melody, and so, no life can be seen. This is what eternity feels like…not unchanging, but unaffected. When it does change its catalyst will not be will…it will be won’t. Not freedom, but apathy.

The loneliness the light must feel knowing that the rays reflected here do so because they are forced to, or maybe it’s completely unintentionally. This scene does not want anything, so what happens is always unappreciated. The masses gather above the masses, which gather above the masses. Space moves and shifts. Perception moves and shifts too. The small can seem large and the large small. Whereas I see futility, it is clear that nothing in this scene understands anything. The life-sustaining immunity of objects in limbo.

As always, take my words with a grain of salt, do your own research, and be careful.
