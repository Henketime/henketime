What makes music vulnerable? If you believe music to be, somehow, inanimate, you may argue that music can’t be vulnerable, and that it <em>just is</em>. So much shaky air in so much three-dimensional space. My body knows different. It tells me that music is a channel to and from the infinite. An arrow from nowhere that can be experienced behind the self, hurtling through space, yet leaving a permanent wake. Music creates piercing memory. Its mark follows us even after every cell in our body has come and gone, replaced by the trail of matter that follows us into our future. The invitation that some music brings for us to follow it into a state of vulnerability belies vulnerable, and if we can follow, we should follow.

ULTRA PARADISE is that infinite arrow and that matter trail. Unlike my last thousand human conversations, I could tell what was being asking of me. Seconds after hearing the first note, I knew exactly where this album was going to live in my body. Neither half of Angel Electronics has ever become vulnerable in front of me. Strange, but this mundane fact is exceptional because, despite a lack of mutual offering, I have made myself vulnerable to their music. I did this without knowing what it would bring. How fortunate are we that we are provided such a space to become susceptible to the unknown!

Opening myself up in this way provided me with uncounted opportunities. In the roughly 32 minutes of ULTRA PARADISE I revealed and named emotions previously obscured by other known emotions. <em>Brutal euphoria</em> (of the band’s self-described brutal euphoria wave genre) is just one of those uncovered using the pick, brush, and HiDE iN SEW provided to me by my guides. Sitting down for my task, I see everything prepared is laid out for me. I can feel rough bone rooted in the earth beneath the warm sand. My drive for discovery courses through my body, keeping both fast and slow time as each sweep parts one reality to propel another forth. An odd arrangement of material, for sure, but one that I’m strangely familiar with. The entire underground form talks to me in verse. I know these emotions, and I’ve sung these songs. I am certain that I will sing them again! I am giddy, and maybe I shouldn’t be. Madness is experiencing ancient things, long buried, returning to awaken a part of our truth. “We were all brutal once”. Yes! Our machinery does still carry the chug chug chug of visceral victory. Happiness has survived because happiness followed survival. Daily I am reminded of the struggle of living, but not the struggle of surviving. I hunger for knowledge and novelty, but yet I only require what my ancestors required. Happiness no longer follows survival. I senselessly satisfy my body’s needs as I sit here, inhabiting a sonic world that asks me to change my geometry in order to receive it. I move and bend, open and expand. Can I really RETURN TO THE SKY? I am connected, and can finally fully take shape. In my minds eye, I have become somehow familiar. I let the vibrations move through me, shifting the sands around and over me. I have lost track of where I am in the sound. Then, striking the chord of a cassette tape in a console, I am reminded, “Angel Electronics”, sweetly marking the experience in a place outside of time. My new shape proves an incredibly effective means to receive maximum comfort from the album’s overwhelming points, bumps, ridges, and grooves. Oh the grooves! I am transfixed, and my body forgets survival for good. In the darkness and weight of the sand blanket, I realize, with great reassurance that my silhouette must look like that lovely bone I saw once. My vulnerability has become my happiness.

As always, take my words with a grain of salt, do your own research, and be careful.
